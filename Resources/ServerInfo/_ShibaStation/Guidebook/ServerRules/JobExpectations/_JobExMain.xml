  # Job Expectations

  Here you will find the expectations for each job on the station.

  Some jobs are more important than others, and jobs of less importance will be noted as such. You will still be expected to perform your duties, but you will not be expected to perform them to the same standard as more important jobs.

  Antagonists are exempt from following job expectations, but you'll probably blow your cover if you do!

  ## Command

  Command staff are expected to be the most active and responsive staff on the station. They are expected to be available for communication with the crew at all times, and to be able to respond to any emergencies that may arise. Command staff have the highest authority on the station, before CentComm.
