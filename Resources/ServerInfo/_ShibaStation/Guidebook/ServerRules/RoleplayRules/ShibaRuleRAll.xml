  # IN GAME & ROLEPLAY RULES

    These rules apply to everyone the moment the round starts and until the lobby screen reappears.

    The deathmatch and sandbox gamemodes are exempt from these rules. Players who choose to not follow these rules are entirely responsible for knowing if an exempt game mode is active.

    Players who are inside the Murderbox are exempt from these rules.

    Players in the Ghost Bar must adhere to the Ghost Bar rules.

    Roleplay rules do not apply to ghosts/spectators/observers while they are ghosts/spectators/observers. Dead chat is considered to be an in-game out of character chat channel.

    See the list of role types for more information about the different types of roles.
